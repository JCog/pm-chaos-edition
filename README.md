This is a mod of Paper Mario that makes things a bit more chaotic. Built using [papermario-dx][dx-repo], it frequently enables random effects for a much more difficult (and often unfair!) experience.

Work is still in progress, but if you'd like to contribute, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) to learn how to get started. I have a fairly clear idea of how I want this mod to play, so I'd recommend reaching out before doing anything substantial to make sure your effort isn't wasted.
